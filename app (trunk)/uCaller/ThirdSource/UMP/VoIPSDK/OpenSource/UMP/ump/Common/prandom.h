/**Mersenne Twister random number generator.
 An application would create a static instance of this class, and then use
 if to generate a sequence of psuedo-random numbers.
 
 Usually an application would simply use PRandom::Number() but if
 performance is an issue then it could also create a static local variable
 such as:
 {
 static PRandom rand;
 for (i = 0; i < 10000; i++)
 array[i] = rand;
 }
 
 This method is not thread safe, so it is the applications responsibility
 to assure that its calls are single threaded.
