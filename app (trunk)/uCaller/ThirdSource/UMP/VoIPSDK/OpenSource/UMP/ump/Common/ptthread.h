// PThread

/** This class defines a thread of execution in the system. A {\it thread} is
 an independent flow of processor instructions. This differs from a
 {\it process} which also embodies a program address space and resource
 allocation. So threads can share memory and resources as they run in the
 context of a given process. A process always contains at least one thread.
 This is reflected in this library by the #PProcess# class being
 descended from the PThread class.
 
 The implementation of a thread is platform dependent, but it is
 assumed that the platform has some support for native threads.
 Previous versions of PWLib has some support for co-operative
 threads, but this has been removed
