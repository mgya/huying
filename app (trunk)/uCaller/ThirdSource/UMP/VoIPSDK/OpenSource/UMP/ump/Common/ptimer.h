/**
 A class representing a system timer. The time interval ancestor value is
 the amount of time left in the timer.
 
 A timer on completion calls the virtual function #OnTimeout()#. This
 will in turn call the callback function provided by the instance. The user
 may either override the virtual function or set a callback as desired.
 
 A list of active timers is maintained by the applications #PProcess#
 instance and the timeout functions are executed in the context of a single
 thread of execution. There are many consequences of this: only one timeout
 function can be executed at a time and thus a user should not execute a
 lot of code in the timeout call-back functions or it will dealy the timely
 execution of other timers call-back functions.
 
 Also timers are not very accurate in sub-second delays, even though you can
 set the timer in milliseconds, its accuracy is only to -0/+250 ms. Even
 more (potentially MUCH more) if there are delays in the user call-back
 functions.
 
 Another trap is you cannot destroy a timer in its own call-back. There is
 code to cause an assert if you try but it is very easy to accidentally do
 this when you delete an object that contains an onject that contains the
 timer!
 
 Finally static timers cause race conditions on start up and termination and
 should be avoided.
